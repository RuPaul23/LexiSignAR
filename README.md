# LexiSignAR (AR Glass for Disability People)

## 🧠 Overview

**LexiSignAR** is a real-time assistive system designed to bridge communication gaps between individuals who use American Sign Language (ASL) and those who do not. It combines deep learning with immersive augmented reality (AR) to enable seamless sign-to-text and text-to-sign translation using custom-built AR glasses.
